MediaEditor is an extendable library for iOS that allows you to quickly and easily add image editing features to your app. You can edit single or multiple images, from the device's library or any other source. It has been designed to feel natural and part of the OS.

## Usage

Using `MediaEditor` is very simple, just give it the media and present from a `ViewController`:

```swift
let assets: [PHAsset] = [asset1, asset2, asset3]
let mediaEditor = MediaEditor(assets)
mediaEditor.edit(from: self, onFinishEditing: { images, actions in
    // images contains the returned images, edited or not
    // actions contains the actions made during this session
}, onCancel: {
    // User canceled
})
```

This presents the MediaEditor from the `ViewController` with a callback that is called when the user is finished editing.

You can easily determine if an image has been edited by checking the `isEdited` property of the objects returned in the `images` array.

You can initialize the `MediaEditor` with a single or an array of: `PHAsset`, `UIImage` or any other entity that conforms to `AsyncImage`.

## More Examples

Check the Example app for even more ways to use the MediaEditor:

* Device Library: Edit media from the device library and output them in a `UICollectionView`
* Remote Image: Edit media that is remotely hosted by conforming to the `AsyncImage` protocol and downloading high-quality images only when needed.
* Plain UIImage: Editing plain UIImage's
* Extending the `MediaEditor` capability by adding your own brightness extension
